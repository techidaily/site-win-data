We are in the preview stage of out Kickstarter campaign and I want to know how to download the video for a trade show. The video was uploaded by our video company and so I do not have the video. Is there a way to download the video directly from Kickstarter?

Do you also have the need to download Kickstarter videos for a trade show, for spreading to your friends, for archive or only for offline viewing? If so, read through the whole article.

The more Kickstarter videos have spread to more people the bigger chance that the Kickstarter project can get the demanded amount of fund, but Kickstarter only allows users to share the project video to social websites, like Facebook, Tweet, etc to spread, but not to download any project video.
